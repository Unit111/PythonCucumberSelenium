# PythonCucumberSelenium
A simple test project using Python 3 which uses Cucumber to run Selenium 3 tests.

Since this is a Python3 project, you will need to use aloe to run the tests.

pip install aloe

pip install selenium

After installing aloe, run the following command:
aloe <path_to_feature_file_or_dir>

Note also that the Geckdriver provided is the 64-bit Windows one. If you have different setup you may need to change it.
